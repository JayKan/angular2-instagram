I was reading your overview.
You work for paypal???
Where did you apply?
Could you call your boss, and tell him that Uncle John needs a gig? 
Um... Paula's kid's uncle john.
Somehow... The company is a subsidiary of my parent family corporation filed under my sister's name. 
Which means: my nephew would sort of be like a Yama (the evil overlord of your highest boss: which would probably be Rick and Birdy or someone from Nebraska affilliated with the Zellner Trust in Wyoming)
Those people...
Are only paying in Gambino Counterfeit (ATM Cash) while they sit there collecting flat out old 1930s bank notes...
I understand them to be the primary liabilities of your company. Theyve always been liabilities of ours.
They would be like founding fathers... like major share holders or something like that.

When they came to be criminally wanted in Wyoming: they moved to Nebraska.
and they are pressing charges against you and the entire corporation while trying to dump the stock into our names to save their own asses from doing prison time.





Do you know anyone who could hook me up?
I am kind of lacking in resource...
Will work for food, travel tix, or gear.

Have links to all my buttons and amazon and ko-fi.com up and such.

PayPal...
Should allow us to slap liens against everyone's things and back them up with police interaction.
For me to pull that off: I had to start going through agencies in the U.K. and Russia who are better at getting stuff done in the states.
Thus why one should send a 9 million dollar debt to someone they dislike: especially if and when in the middle of high crime, such as when kidnapped or after a suspicious death.
